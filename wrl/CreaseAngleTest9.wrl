#VRML V2.0 utf8

# Tests if duplication of edges works correctly on a closed shape with a smooth edge and sharp edges

# Initially, this shape has several problems:
## 1. When the left and right panels are enabled, the edge between them is smooth, as by design and by the defined creaseAngle
#     but when the top panel is enabled too, all edges are sharp. The edges between the top and side panels should be sharp, but the edge
#     between the right and left panel should still be smooth.
## 2. When the bottom panel is also enabled, a diagonal line appears in the right panel, exposing the triangulation of that panel.
#     In this case, the same error as in situation 1 is also visible.

#VRML V2.0 utf8

# This represents a solid green box, built as an IndexedFaceSet
# All edges should be sharply rendered
# As a comparison the is a red box in the scene. They should look the same.
# They actually _do_ look the same, when for both of them, vertexNormals are computed.
# @todo: add a pre-triangulated shape, because it might render better
# @todo: compare clockwise and counterclockwise, to find errors in their processing algorithm
# @todo Why does vaneyck.wrl render strangely? It is built badly, or is the face duplication algortithm wrong?
# try a cylinder in CreaseAngleTest5.wrl
